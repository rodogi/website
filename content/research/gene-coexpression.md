In this study, we used a multilayer network approach to uncover fundamental structural principles in gene co-expression networks (GCNs) that are disrupted in breast cancer. By analyzing both healthy and cancerous gene co-expression networks, we identified key differences in connectivity patterns, revealing how healthy cells maintain a complex network of gene interactions across chromosomes. In contrast, the breast cancer network exhibits a loss of these inter-chromosomal connections, leading to a simpler, more localized structure confined largely to genes within the same chromosome.

Our findings suggest that the healthy network’s structure may reflect an underlying organizational principle that supports cellular function, while the loss of inter-chromosomal connectivity in cancer could be linked to the disease’s progression. This work provides a new framework for studying the co-expression landscape and offers insights into how disruptions in gene networks may contribute to the onset of cancer
