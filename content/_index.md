introduction: "My research at [NetSI](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) applies network science to understand complex systems in biology, biomedicine, and the science of science. Working in the group of [Albert-László Barabási](https://barabasi.com/science), I develop computational methods to quantify the impact of biobanks, biomedical tools, and publication venues on scientific careers and innovation. My work also extends to network medicine—building tools for large-scale drug–disease screening—and to auditing how AI systems recognize scientific contributions. Previously, I studied the structure and function of biological networks, including protein interaction networks and gene co-expression in cancer."
